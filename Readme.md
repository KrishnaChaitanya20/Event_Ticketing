    git clone https://github.com/KrishnaChaitanya20/EventManagement.git
    ```

2. Set up the MongoDB database:

    - Install MongoDB and start the MongoDB service.
    - Create a new database named `events`.

3. Update the environment variables:

    - In `Backend` folder rename `.env.example` to `.env`
    - Update the database connection details in the `.env` file.
    - In `Frontend` folder rename `.env.example` to `.env`
    - Update the backend connection details in the `.env` file.
